# MetaBreaker 🎲

MetaBreaker (v1.1) is a League of Legends item build generator that helps you create off-meta builds for every champion. This web application is made by five people as a fun project, and more updates are on the way.

## Usage 🕹️

To use MetaBreaker, simply head to  [home](https://metabreaker.vercel.app/)  and select a champion. MetaBreaker will generate a random off-meta item build for that champion. You can press 'Roll Again' to generate a new build.

## Development 👨‍💻

This web application is built using Next.js and Chakra UI. It also utilizes the Riot Games Data Dragon to gather data about champions and items.
