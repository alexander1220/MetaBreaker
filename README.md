# MetaBreaker

MetaBreaker is a League of Legends item build generator that helps you create off-meta builds for every champion. This web application is made by three people as a fun project, and updates are on the way.

## Usage 🕹️

To use MetaBreaker, simply visit the website [here]() and select a champion. The website will generate a random item build that is off-meta for that champion. You can press 'ROLL' to generate a new build.

## Development 👨‍💻

This web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also utilizes the Riot Games Data Dragon to gather data about champions and items.
